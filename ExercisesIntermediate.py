#This is my collection of Python training exercises for intermediate level.
#These exercises are written in simple English for beginners.
#Because my native language is French, and I am still learning English,
#But my English in this file is an improvement over my first file (BeginnerExercises).

"""After these exercises I will be able to do any project I want in python """      

                                #These exercises focus on working with characters.
